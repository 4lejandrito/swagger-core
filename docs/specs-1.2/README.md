### Samples to support Swagger 1.2 specification, roughly outlined here:

```
https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/Specification-Roadmap
```

In the samples so far:

1.0 Protocol declaration

2.0 Content-type declaration for `produces` and `consumes`

3.0 Authorization (per [contribution](https://gist.github.com/7d481e6d509630127e6a))

Samples will be used to describe the output, then rolled up into documentation on the wiki
